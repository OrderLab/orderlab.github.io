<h1>OrderLab is growing!</h1>

We are seeking PhD students with strong systems building skills
(e.g., kernel programming, Android framework hacking, distributed
system operations) and motivation for research. Background in program
languages, compiler, and formal methods will be a bonus point. Non-technical
qualities including critical thinking, perseverance, communication,
self driven are valuable as well for graduate school in general.

However, I don't expect applicants to be skilled in everything
mentioned above. It is my goal to help train my students to
be well-rounded researchers throughout the PhD education. Thus,
students who do not have much related background but show promise
that the above skills can be developed are also encouraged to apply.

We are also open to working with Masters and undergraduate students. Students
who have taken undergrad OS (<a href="https://os.eecs.umich.edu">EECS 482</a>, <a
href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/jhu/cs318/fall22/index.html">CS 318/418/618</a>) or grad OS
class (<a href="https://eecs582.github.io">EECS 582</a>, <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/jhu/cs718/spring20/index.html">CS
718</a>) are preferred.

## How to Apply
Prospective PhD students should apply through **University of Michigan CSE** [admission 
systems](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/admissions) by **December 15th** 
and mention me in your application. It is helpful to <a href="mailto:ryanph@umich.edu">email</a>
me for inquiries before applying (please attach your CV) or for letting me
know you have applied afterwards. I can't promise to reply every email but I
do read most of them.

Current U-M students can make an appointment with me via email.
