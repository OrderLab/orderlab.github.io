    <h3>Fall '21 Group Hike</h3>
    <p>After more than one year of working from home due to the pandemic, our group is finally able to get together!! We did a (masked) group hike in the Cascade Falls Loop Trail in late August, and hiked twice longer than planned due to Ryan's misleading instruction :D

    <h3>Fall '19 Group Hike</h3>
    <p>We did our first group hike on the last day of August. We hiked in the Annapolis Rock part of <a href="https://dnr.maryland.gov/publiclands/Pages/at.aspx">Appalachian Trail</a>. A healthy way to kick off the Fall '19 semester.</p>
