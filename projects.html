    <p>Currently, we have two main lines of investigations. One line is related to rethink availability and fault tolerance in cloud systems.
    The other is on defensive mobile operating systems to tolerate misbehaving apps.</p>

            <p>In this work, we advocate that modern software needs intrinsic failure detectors that 
              are tailored to individual systems and can detect anomalies within a process at finer 
              granularity. We particularly advocate a notion of intrinsic software watchdogs and propose 
              an abstraction for it. Among the different styles of watchdogs, we believe watchdogs 
              that imitate the main program can provide the best combination of completeness, accuracy 
              and localization for detecting gray failures.
            </p>
            <p>
              We write a position paper on the watchdog abstraction and an early 
              exploration for automatically generating mimic-type watchdogs. This

            <p>In this work, we build on insights from our position paper, particularly
              that the key trait of gray failure is a form of differential observability.
              We find that in a highly-interactive cloud system, while gray failure is subtle
              and ambiguous by itself, the "requesters" in the system often observe the
              failure symptoms. We build a tool, <b>Panorama</b>, that uses program analysis 
              and AOP instrumentation to systematically place observability hooks in a system 
              component, which will report gray failure in other components at runtime.
            </p>

              We write a paper that describes this solution and evaluation results. This

            <p>Cloud scale provides the vast resources necessary to replace failed
              components, but this is useful only if those failures can be detected.
              For this reason, the major availability breakdowns and performance
              anomalies we see in cloud environments tend to be caused by subtle
              underlying faults, i.e., <b>gray failure</b>. In this work, we present 
              real-world gray failure examples to
              understand their characteristics and the risks they pose to cloud
              systems. Drawing from these data points, we make the first
              attempt to characterize gray failure with a generic model. We find 
              that the key trait of gray failure is a form of <b>differential observability</b>.

            <p> Existing OS-level solutions to the mobile app energy misbehavior problem is either 
              libertarian, which allows apps to hold resources until they are explicitly released, 
              or authoritarian, which monitors resource usages and throttles excessive usage. 
              While the authoritarian approach helps reduce energy consumption, it prohibits apps 
              from taking advantage of the resources to do useful work. In this project, we 
              explore a missing design point---a utilitarian approach. We adapt the lease mechanism 
              from distributed systems into a mobile OS resource management abstraction to mitigate 
              app energy bugs and use utility to make informed lease decisions.

            <p>Nowadays there's an app for almost anything. Unfortunately, mobile apps are in general
              weaker in terms of quality compared to traditional software because of developer inexperiences
              and limited resources. Many apps, despite having useful features, exhibit immature behaviors,
            e.g., fast battery drain, agressive updates, excessive cellular data usage, notifications.</p>

            <p>In the <b>DefDroid</b> project, we explore OS-level solutions to
              address the Disruptive App Behavior (DAB). DefDroid is designed to defensively
              re-act to app misbehavior by taking corrective actions at runtime without
            compromising app usability.</p>
